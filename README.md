## Papers

### Retrieval

- [RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks](./papers/rag.md) - An information retrieval augmented generation model that can be used for various knowledge-intensive NLP tasks. (Lewis, Patrick, et al. 2020)

- [CRAG - Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation](./papers/crag.md) - Enhance the robustness of language model generation by evaluating and augmenting the relevance of retrieved documents through a an evaluator and large-scale web searches. (Shi-Qi Yan, Jia-Chen Gu, et al. 2024) [(llamapack)](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/tree/main/llama-index-packs/llama-index-packs-corrective-rag)

- [Dense x Retrieval: What Retrieval Grnaularity Should We Use?](./papers/dense-retrieval.md) - Improve dense retrieval by using a more fine-grained retrieval granularity as known as Propositions. (Tong Chen, et al. 2023) [(llamapack)](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/tree/main/llama-index-packs/llama-index-packs-dense-x-retrieval)

- [RA-DIT: Retrieval-Augmented Dual Instruction Tuning (RA-DIT)](./papers/ra-dit.md) - Improve the performance of retrieval-augmented generation models by fine-tuning the retrieval and generation components jointly. (Khattar, Dheeraj, et al. 2021)

### RAG With Knowledge Graphs

### Evaluation

### Agents/Tools

### Survey Papers

- [Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models: A Survey](./papers/rag-survey.md) - This survey paper examines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in Large Language Models, discussing three paradigms‚ÄîNaive, Advanced, and Modular RAG‚Äîand their key components. It evaluates RAG's impact on accuracy, hallucination reduction, and knowledge updates, also suggesting future research directions for enhancing RAG's effectiveness and scalability. (Yunfan Gao, et al. 2023)
