## Papers

- [RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks](./papers/rag.md) - An information retrieval augmented generation model that can be used for various knowledge-intensive NLP tasks. (Lewis, Patrick, et al. 2020)

- [RA-DIT: Retrieval-Augmented Dual Instruction Tuning (RA-DIT)](./papers/ra-dit.md) - Improve the performance of retrieval-augmented generation models by fine-tuning the retrieval and generation components jointly. (Khattar, Dheeraj, et al. 2021)

- [CRAG - Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation Llama Pack](./papers/crag.md) - Enhance the robustness of language model generation by evaluating and augmenting the relevance of retrieved documents through a an evaluator and large-scale web searches. (Shi-Qi Yan, Jia-Chen Gu, et al. 2024)

- [Dense x Retrieval: What Retrieval Grnaularity Should We Use?](./papers/dense-retrieval.md) - Improve dense retrieval by using a more fine-grained retrieval granularity as known as Propositions. (Tong Chen, et al. 2023)
